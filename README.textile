h1. HyperTouch: 

HyperTouch is a native extension for Haxe / NME to handle native gestures on your Android & iOS devices.

h2. Getting started

First include the path to the HyperTouch folder in your NMML project file.

<pre><code><include path="extensions/hypertouch" if="mobile"/></code></pre>

Adding listener :

<pre><code>
var hyp = HyperTouch.getInstance( );
    hyp.addEventListener( GestureTapEvent.TAP , _onTap , false );
    hyp.addEventListener( GesturePinchEvent.PINCH , _onPinch , false );
    hyp.addEventListener( GestureTapEvent.TWO_FINGERS_TAP , _onTwoFingers , false );
    hyp.addEventListener( GestureTapEvent.DOUBLE_TAP , _onDoubleTap , false );
    hyp.addEventListener( GestureSwipeEvent.SWIPE , _onSwipe , false );
    hyp.addEventListener( GesturePanEvent.PAN , _onPan , false );
    hyp.addEventListener( GestureSwipeEvent.SWIPE , _onSwipe , false );
</code></pre>

h2. TODO:

I'm not an Objective-C / Java pro-coder, so any suggestion / optimization is welcome.

- TwoFingers Tap on Android
- Velocity on some Gestures
